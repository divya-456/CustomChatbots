The true product is a complex between \nthe Grignard reagent and, probably, two molecules of the ether solvent, as Mg(II) prefers a tetrahedral structure.\nMore on making Grignard reagents\nThe reaction takes place not in solution but on the surface of the metal, and how easy it is to make a Grignard reagent can depend on the state of the surface\u2014how \ufb01  nely divided the metal is, for example. Magnesium is usually covered by a thin coating of magnesium oxide, and Grignard formation generally requires \u2018initiation\u2019 to allow the metal to come into direct contact with the alkyl halide. Initiation usually means adding a small amount of iodine or 1,2-diiodoethane, or using ultrasound to dislodge the oxide layer. Once the Grignard starts to form, it catalyses further reactions of Mg(0), perhaps by this mechanism:\nXMg\nR\nXMg\nRRMg\nX\nRMg\nXRXRMg\nX\nMg",

    "content": "Making organometallics\nHow to make Grignard reagents\nGrignard reagents are made by reacting magnesium turnings with alkyl halides in ether solv-ents to form solutions of alkylmagnesium halide. Iodides, bromides, and chlorides can be used, as can both aryl and alkyl halides. Our examples include methyl, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl halides, aryl and allyl halides. They cannot contain any functional groups that would react with the Grignard reagent once it is formed. The \ufb01  nal example has an acetal \nfunctional group as an example of one that does not react with the Grignard reagent.
